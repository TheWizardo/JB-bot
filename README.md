# JB-bot
Israeli Junior Branch Telegram Bot

## About
This telegram bot was created by Oz Sabbag with the help of Amitay Abudy and Ziv Yatziv.  
This bot was made to make the life of the JBers of JB Israel easier by getting easy access to general info about upcoming activities, info about the cisv and more.  
You can also access to info about other JBers like phone numbers and roles in the JB and CISV.  
The bot was created in 2017.

# General Maintenance
> If you are able to improve current code, do so.

* Try to keep the bot up and running at all possible time so he could answer questions and not missing any birthdays ):
* Keep the code readable. Use spaces, reasonable variable names, comments, etc...
* Try to periodically check commands and the CSV file.
* Fix bugs as soon as possible.
* Don't forget to commit any changes that have been made, so everything will be up to date and all the data will be backed up.
* In case you didnâ€™t know, you can access more commands, which you can find under the command "/dev".
Use your new power wisely; as the great uncle Ben once said: **"With great power come great responsibilities."**
