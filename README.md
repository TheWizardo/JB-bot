# JB-bot
Israeli Junior Branch Telegram Bot

## General Maintenance
If you are able to improve current code, do so.
Try to keep the bot up and running at all possible time so he could answer questions and not miss saying "happy birthday".
Keep the code readable. Use spaces, reasonable variable names, comments.
Try to periodically check commands and the csv file.
Fix bugs as soon as possible.
Upload new files to the drive once changes are made, so everything will be up to date and all the data will be backed up.
In case you didn’t know, you can access more commands, which you can find under the command "/dev". Use your new power wisely; as the great uncle ben once said, "With great power come great responsibilities."
